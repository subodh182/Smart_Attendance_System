# Attendance Management System Using Face Recognition 🎓📸

An advanced Python-based Attendance Management System that leverages facial recognition technology for marking attendance. This system provides both automated and manual options, making it versatile and user-friendly. Built for educational and organizational purposes, it ensures efficiency and accuracy in attendance tracking.

## Features

### Automated Attendance

Uses LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histogram) for facial recognition.

Detects and recognizes faces using the Haar Cascade algorithm.

Stores attendance records automatically in CSV format.

### Manual Attendance

User-friendly GUI for manual entry of attendance data.

Allows adding subjects and student details with ease.

Exports data as CSV files for further analysis.

### Data Management

Organizes training images and attendance records in a structured folder hierarchy.

Stores trained models for efficient face recognition.

## 🔧 Installation

Prerequisites 

Python 3.8+ (Ensure Python and pip are installed)

A working webcam (for automated attendance)


#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

``` bash 
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Attendance-Management-System.git
cd Attendance-Management-System 
```

#### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install required Python packages using:

```bash
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Step 3: Configure Paths

Update the Paths acording Your System file to match your directory structure:

```python 
{
    "icon_path": "AMS.ico",
    "output_folder": "Attendance",
    "haar_cascade_path": "haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml"
}

```

#### Step 4: Prepare Training Data

Add training images in the TrainingImage folder.

Use the naming format: Name_ID.jpg (e.g., John_001.jpg).

## 🚀 Usage

Running the Application

Launch the main application:

```bash 
python main.py
```

##### **Choose one of the two modes:**

***Manual Attendance: Fill attendance via GUI.***

***Automated Attendance: Use face recognition to mark attendance.***

**Training the Model**

***To train the face recognition model:***

```bash
python attendance_recognition.py
```

**This script will:**

Load images from the TrainingImage folder.

Train the recognizer and save the model in the TrainingImageLabel folder.

Attendance Records

Automated and manual attendance records are saved as CSV files in the Attendance folder.

The filename format is: Subject_Date_Time.csv.
